# Task 5: Multi-Modal Chatbot

This project implements a multi-modal chatbot capable of processing both text and image inputs. It uses a FastAPI backend integrated with Google's Gemini AI for response generation and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can send text messages to the chatbot and receive AI-generated responses.
- **Image Input**: Users can upload images (JPEG/PNG), and the chatbot generates captions or descriptions using Gemini AI.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with FastAPI, supporting asynchronous requests and retries for rate-limited API calls.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Streamlit provides a simple, user-friendly interface.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of API errors, image processing issues, and rate limits.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Google Gemini AI, Pydantic, Pillow, python-dotenv
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, Requests
- **Environment**: Python 3.9+

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Google Gemini API Key (set in a `.env` file)
- Installed dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task5-multimodal-chatbot.git
cd task5-multimodal-chatbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
requests
pydantic
Pillow
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
streamlit
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.

### 4. Run the Backend
Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
python backend.py
```
The server will run on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` by default.

### 5. Run the Frontend
In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Usage
1. **Text Input**: Type a message in the text area and click "Send" to get a response.
2. **Image Input**: Upload a JPG, JPEG, or PNG file, optionally with text, and click "Send" to receive a response with an image caption.
3. **Response**: The chatbot’s response will appear below the input section.

## Project Structure

├── backend.py          # FastAPI backend code
├── frontend.py         # Streamlit frontend code
├── .env                # Environment variables (not tracked)
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Example
- **Text Input**: "Tell me about the solar system."
  - **Response**: A detailed text description from Gemini AI.
- **Image Input**: Upload a photo of a cat.
  - **Response**: "Image Caption (Gemini): A fluffy orange cat sitting on a windowsill."

## Notes
- Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend.
- The backend handles rate limits with exponential backoff (up to 5 retries).
- Image processing converts RGBA to RGB for compatibility with JPEG encoding.

## Troubleshooting
- **API Key Error**: Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`.
- **Backend Not Responding**: Check if `http://localhost:8000` is accessible.
- **Image Upload Fails**: Ensure the file is a supported format (JPG, JPEG, PNG).

### Notes for You:
- Replace `your-username` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username.
- If this is part of a larger project or course, customize the "Acknowledgments" section with specific context.
- Add a `requirements.txt` file with the listed dependencies if not already present.
- If you want to include screenshots or a demo GIF, add them under a "Demo" section with GitHub-compatible image links.
