#Tasks

1. Implement an extractive summarization technique to create concise summaries of longer documents. Expected Outcome: A tool that generates summaries by selecting and combining the most important sentences from the original text.

2. Use three different open-source LLMs to build an article generator chatbot. Report on the three LLMs, assess their performance, and identify which LLM is most appropriate for article creation

3. Add basic analytics to track user interactions, such as number of queries, most common topics, and user satisfaction ratings. Expected Outcome: A dashboard displaying key metrics about chatbot usage.

4. Develop a Medical Q&A Chatbot using the MedQuAD Dataset Link: https://github.com/abachaa/MedQuAD Create a specialized medical question-answering chatbot using the MedQuAD dataset. Implementation of a retrieval mechanism to find relevant answers. Basic medical entity recognition (e.g., symptoms, diseases, treatments). Simple user interface using Streamlit for asking medical questions

5. Develop a multi-modal chatbot Explanation: Extend the chatbot to handle and generate both text and image content using Google Palm and Gemini AI capabilities. Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can understand image inputs, generate relevant images, and seamlessly integrate visual and textual information in conversations.

6. Implement a system for dynamically expanding the chatbot's knowledge base. Create a mechanism to periodically update the vector database with new information from specified sources. Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can automatically incorporate new information into its responses over time.

7. Develop a chatbot that serves as an expert in a specific domain, capable of answering complex queries and explaining concepts. Use the arXiv dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) for scientific papers in various fields. Train the chatbot on a specific subset of the arXiv dataset (e.g., computer science). Implement advanced NLP techniques for information extraction, summarization, and user open source LLM for explanation generation. Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can discuss advanced topics in the chosen field, provide summaries of research papers, and explain complex concepts. Ability to handle follow-up questions on complex topics. Implement using Streamlit with features for paper searching and concept visualization

8. Extend the existing chatbot to support at least three additional languages beyond its original language. The chatbot should be able to detect the user's language automatically, switch between languages seamlessly, and provide culturally appropriate responses. Additionally, implement advanced language processing features to enhance the chatbot's understanding and generation capabilities across all supported languages

9. Integrate sentiment analysis into the chatbot to detect and respond appropriately to customer emotions during interactions. Expected Outcome: A chatbot that can recognize and address positive, negative, or neutral sentiments in user messages. Evaluation Criteria: Accuracy of sentiment detection, appropriateness of responses to different sentiments, impact on customer satisfaction.
